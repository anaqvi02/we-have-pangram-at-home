The Independent Jane
For all the love, romance and scandal in Jane Austen’s books, what they are really about is freedom and independence. Independence of thought and the freedom to choose.
Elizabeth’s refusal of Mr. Collins offer of marriage showed an independence seldom seen in heroines of the day. Her refusal of Mr. Darcy while triggered by anger showed a level of independence that left him shocked and stunned.
The freedom she exhibited in finally accepting him in direct defiance of Lady Catherine and knowing her father would disapprove was unusual even for Austen. In her last book Anne Elliot is persuaded to refuse Captain Wentworth at Lady Russel’s insistence.
Although Jane played by the rules of the day, all of her writing is infused with how she wanted life to be. She ‘screams’ her outrage at the limitations for women in Emma.
When accosted by Mrs. Elton, Jane Fairfax says,
“Excuse me, ma’am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon produce something — offices for the sale, not quite of human flesh, but of human intellect.”
“Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition.”
“I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,” replied Jane; “governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely different certainly, as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies.”
That same sentiment is emphasized in Emma’s shock when Mrs. Weston tells her of Frank Churchill’s secret engagement to Jane.
“Good God!” cried Emma, “Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself — to suffer her even to think of such a measure!”
I find it interesting that at the moment of Austen’s birth or there about, John Adams left his farm in Massachusetts for the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Doesn’t sound particularly interesting, I know but consider this.
John Adams left his home in mid-December 1775 to attend an unprecedented meeting of colonial representatives to consider severing ties with their mother country and her monarch; a decision that culminated in a document unlike any ever written. In the mother country, one day in that same cold December a baby girl was born at Steventon Rectory. Her cry was heard by only the people in the house but the years to come would see her pen create works unlike any the world had ever seen.
Comparing Austen’s words with Thomas Jefferson’s may seem a trivialization but I believe that Austen’s impact on the world is no less important than Jefferson’s. The effect of Jane’s writing maybe more subtle than that of the Virginian but it is no less influential.
Jefferson’s words instigated and promoted a revolution, a war of independence. Jane’s words had no such excessive consequence. Still in her own quiet, genteel yet powerful way she declared and promoted the same principles of freedom and self-regulated independence as our American forefathers. In all her novels Jane advocates independence of person and thought, the rights of all and acceptance of responsibility for those rights.
Jane may not have incited military action as Jefferson did but even as an avowed royalist, I doubt not that Jane Austen firmly believed in his declaration of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Hanukkah begins this year on December 1st, at sundown. Be honest. When I say “Hanukkah,” the first thing you think of is the Adam Sandler song, talking about “eight crazy nights.” If you are a little more connected to Jewish culture, you may also think about a dreidel or potato latkes (pancakes). While it’s commonly called the “Festival of Lights,” a better translation is “Dedication.” Being Jewish (circumcised at 8 days, Bar Mitzvah at age 13) and a Christ-follower (for over 15 years), I’d like to give a brief explanation of this holiday, and why it’s a meaningful opportunity to help me worship the Lord.
Here’s the story of Hanukkah: In the 2nd century BC, Antiochus Epiphanes gained control over parts of the Middle East, including Judea (Israel). He erected an altar to Zeus in the Temple in Jerusalem, and sacrificed pigs there, which are unclean to Jews. The Maccabee family led a revolt, finally liberating Jerusalem and the Temple in 165 BC. Before God could be properly worshiped in the Temple, it had to be cleaned and dedicated. The menorah (lamp) had to burn continuously for 8 days for the purification process. Despite there only being enough olive oil for one day, the oil miraculously lasted for 8 days and nights. That is why Hanukkah is celebrated for 8 nights.
Most people consider this miracle to be the end in itself, and I think the bigger meaning is missed. The point isn’t just that God did a miracle, but that the miracle was the means to allow Him to be properly worshiped. The Temple needed to be purified in order for Yahweh to be worshiped, but it couldn’t be purified unless He worked a miracle. God worked a miracle so that His people could be near Him in worship.
Let us not miss that meaning, as we celebrate the Advent of Jesus Christ, the Light of the world (John 8:12). I don’t think we need merely to reflect on the birth of Jesus, but we need to consider why the Father sent His Son. God performed a miracle (the Incarnation) not as an end to itself, but as a means to allow us to be near Him in worship (through Christ’s redemptive sacrifice for our sins). Jesus did not come only to be marveled at as a baby, but to pour out His life and blood, to open the way for a new covenant with Him.

2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine in Global Media Coverage Essay (Critical Writing)

The world has been shattered by Russia’s attack on Ukraine in the past few days. Ukraine’s forces have put up remarkable resistance to this attack, but the war is entering an even bloodier phase. Europe could be witnessing the first major military invasion in years. Many people have been displaced, and many Ukrainian citizens have fled neighboring countries for peace. Gunshots and artillery fires have been raining down on residential areas in Ukraine, with several media houses and newspapers reporting the events and sharing the news with the rest of the world.

Various newspapers have reported the news differently, with the difference seen in headlines, videos and images posted. The two newspapers covering the events in Ukraine are the New York Times and Le Monde, a French newspaper. While New York Times and Le Monde report the same event, the two use very different terms to describe similar activities. In the recent takeover of the city of Kharkiv by the Russian forces, for example, the NYT headline read “Russian Troops Take Over Kharkiv,” Le Monde , on the other hand, read “La Russie A Envahi Kharkiv” to mean “Russia Has Invaded Kharkiv.” Recently a video of Ukrainian citizens making Molotov cocktail Petrol bombs was shared. The headline in NYT read, “Ukraine Prepare Molotov Cocktail In Kyiv.” Le Monde ‘s headline read “Ukrainian Resistance Using Molotov Bombs.” Because headlines are the deciding factor for people to read an article, newspapers make them enticing. The New York Times uses headlines that suggest this is another world war, while Le Monde downplays the illegality of what Russia is doing. The differences seen in the headlines of the two newspapers are all for the attraction of their audiences; each magazine writes eye-catching unique topics.

A Charles Schwab Corporation Case Essay

Charles Schwab is a for-profit Corporation whose main business is savings and loans. The company provides banking and asset management services, and financial advisory. It has several subsidiaries – Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc., which are all limited liability companies (“The Charles Schwab Corporation,” 2021). This paper aims to analyze the form of business in Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC).

Charles Schwab is a corporation, which is a form of business with some distinctive features. Firstly, its officers are agents, unlike its directors and shareholders, which means that the latter are not involved in the company’s current strategic, managerial and other business decisions (“Corporation,” 2022). Secondly, the corporation is managed by the board of directors who have the right to appoint the officers. This approach creates a balance of managerial forces, since CEOs and CFOs are directly involved in the work processes, and the board of directors, in extreme cases, has the right to dismiss them by voting.

In the corporation, shareholders are free to transfer ownership, which means that in critical situations such as bankruptcy, the corporation can be sold to another owner. This outcome is possible because the corporation is an organization that creates an opportunity for investors to profit by investing, unlike an LLC (“Forming a corporation,” 2022). Finally, in corporations, the income is taxed twice: the first time at the corporate level, and a second time if dividends are distributed to shareholders.

Thus, the form of business in Charles Schwab Corporation was analyzed. The CSC is a corporation with several subsidiaries and conducts business following the requirements for a corporation form of organization. A distinctive feature of corporations is the board of directors, which has an indirect influence on daily decision-making. Still, in critical cases, it can appoint new officers to manage the company. Corporations can also transfer property rights in the event of bankruptcy or other cases.

 2.4 Group Dynamics and Team Processes

Introduction

As organizations continue to prioritize teamwork as a means of achieving their goals, understanding group dynamics and team processes has become increasingly important for both practitioners and researchers in organizational behavior. This sub-unit will delve into the classic areas of research within this domain, including group formation, cohesion, norms, roles, decision making, communication, conflict resolution, and leadership. We will explore these concepts through both theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence, highlighting the complexities and nuances inherent in effective team performance. Moreover, we will critically analyze recent research findings and debates in the field, providing an up-to-date overview of the state of knowledge in group dynamics and team processes.

Group Formation

One fundamental aspect of group dynamics involves how groups form. According to Tuckman’s (1965) model, groups typically progress through five stages of development: forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. During the forming stage, members come together, establish initial relationships, and attempt to understand each other’s backgrounds and expectations. Storming follows, characterized by interpersonal conflicts, disagreements over task objectives, and struggles for power and control. Norming occurs when the group begins to resolve its internal disputes, develop shared values and beliefs, and coordinate activities towards common goals. Performing represents the peak of group productivity, where members work collaboratively to achieve desired outcomes. Finally, during the adjourning stage, teams disband or transition to new projects, often leading to feelings of loss and nostalgia among former members.

Recently, scholars such as Hackman (2017) have criticized Tuckman’s model for oversimplifying the complexity of group development. They argue that groups may not always follow a linear path and can experience multiple iterations of various stages throughout their lifecycle. Furthermore, some researchers suggest that certain contextual factors, such as virtuality (i.e., distributed versus colocated), diversity, and technology use, can significantly impact group formation and evolution (O’Leary & Cummings, 2007).

Cohesion

Another central construct in group dynamics concerns cohesion – the degree to which members feel attracted to one another and committed to the group’s mission (Festinger et al., 1950). Research consistently demonstrates that higher levels of cohesion lead to greater job satisfaction, motivation, and performance (Beal et al., 2003; Mullen & Copper, 1994). However, excessive cohesiveness can also result in insular thinking, resistance to change, and even unethical behavior (Kanter, 1972; Shaw, 1981). Therefore, managers must strike a delicate balance between promoting cohesiveness and fostering openness to external perspectives.

Norms

Groups inevitably develop normative structures that guide member behavior and shape social interactions. These informal rules dictate what behaviors are considered appropriate, acceptable, or expected within a given context (Cialdini & Trost, 199

 Sure thing! Here's a draft for the sub-unit "4.2. Fashion and Performance":

**Fashion and Performance**

Have you ever thought about how clothes can help us express ourselves? Just like actors on a stage who use costumes to get into character, we can also use what we wear to show the world who we are and how we feel. This is what we call the interplay between fashion and performance.

When we think of performance, we often picture people singing, dancing, or acting on a stage. But really, performance can happen anywhere – even just walking down the street! Think about it: when you put on a favorite outfit, don’t you feel more confident and ready to take on the day? That’s because what you wear has the power to change how you behave and interact with others.

One famous example of fashion and performance coming together is Lady Gaga. She’s known for her wild outfits and over-the-top performances, but did you know she actually studied fashion design in college before becoming a singer? To her, music and fashion go hand-in-hand, and she uses both to tell stories and make statements.

Another way fashion and performance intersect is through dance. Dancers need special clothing to move freely and look stylish at the same time. Ballet dancers, for instance, wear tutus and pointe shoes to perform gracefully onstage. Hip hop dancers might choose baggy pants and sneakers to match their high-energy moves. In these cases, the clothes become part of the act itself!

But fashion and performance aren’t always glamourous or flashy. Sometimes, they can be quiet and subtle. Take, for example, the “uniform” many professionals wear to work every day. A suit and tie for businessmen, scrubs for doctors, lab coats for scientists – all of these serve a functional purpose, but they also signal something important about the person wearing them. When you see someone in a uniform, you automatically assume certain things about their job and status. In this way, fashion becomes a form of nonverbal communication, helping us convey messages without saying a word.

So next time you get dressed, ask yourself: What message do I want to send today? Whether you’re feeling bold and playful or serious and professional, there’s sure to be an outfit that matches your mood. And remember, the most important thing is to have fun and be true to yourself!

 Title: The Hilarious and Scandalous Wrap Party Video of Boy Meets World: An Inside Look

If you were a fan of the hit '90s TV show, Boy Meets World, then you'll be thrilled to know about the infamous wrap party video that stars none other than Rider Strong (Shawn Hunter) and Will Friedle (Eric Matthews). This salacious video has been shrouded in mystery for over two decades, leaving fans wondering what could possibly be too inappropriate for airtime. While the full video remains under lock and key, Strong recently gave us some juicy details that shed light on its production and contents.

The concept behind the video started as a simple idea during the final season of Boy Meets World. Strong and Friedle thought it would be entertaining to create a mockumentary titled "Where Are They Now?" featuring the cast members playing exaggerated versions of themselves ten years after the show's end. What began as a seemingly innocent endeavor quickly spiraled into something far more provocative, resulting in a highly anticipated yet unseen treasure among diehard followers.

To add authenticity to their characters, Strong and Friedle went all out on costumes and makeup. Fans might find it hard to imagine Strong sporting dreadlocks, but according to him, everyone involved embraced their roles wholeheartedly. Although they initially planned for just a week's worth of filming, the duo ended up investing significantly more time and effort into creating this masterpiece—which clocks in at approximately ten minutes long.

So why hasn't the video seen the light of day? Well, it appears that the humor contained within transcends the boundaries of good taste. With numerous off-color jokes peppered throughout, along with countless insider references meant only for those intimately familiar with the series, releasing such a scandalous piece seemed ill-advised. Nevertheless, it made for quite an entertaining spectacle when screened at the wrap party, providing closure and laughter to those involved in bringing Boy Meets World to life.

One can't help but wonder what exactly transpired in those elusive ten minutes. Did Topanga become a foul-mouthed lawyer? Was Mr. Feeny caught running an underground fight club? Alas, until someone decides to bless the world with the full video, our imaginations will continue conjuring up wild scenarios inspired by Strong's tantalizing descriptions.

Despite the absence of concrete evidence regarding the contents of the rumored tape, its very existence speaks volumes about the camaraderie shared between the cast members. After spending seven seasons together, growing up both on and off-screen, the bonds formed amongst them are undeniable. Their willingness to participate in such a racy endeavor demonstrates trust, affection, and perhaps most importantly, a mutual understanding that sometimes pushing boundaries is necessary for lasting memories.

While we eagerly await any potential future releases of the legendary wrap party video, fans can take solace in knowing that behind the scenes of their beloved childhood program lies a world filled with laughter, friendship, and questionable choices—just like any real high school experience. And if nothing else, isn't that what made Boy Meets World so relatable and endearing in the first place?

On that note, you will have an outrageously car payment just because you were looking down at your phone. Moreover, if you the reason the accident happened the person that was operating the other car can sue you for lots of money, and you will have to pay it. Therefore, if you don't pay whatever the person charges you consequences will be served and that's behind bars.

Drivers should not be able to use phones while operating a vehicle. Drivers who used their phone while operating a vehicle are most likely to get into an accident that could be fatal.

According to an article by the Edgar Snyder Firm, 21% of teens that were part of a fatal car accident was due to phones. According to the same article, 35% know the risk but continue using their phones while on the road. This shows that its beyond dangerous and irresponsible of drivers not to be fully aware of their surroundings while driving. Drivers should be able to concentrate without any distractions, because it could be fatal.

"It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational" Plumer, Source 2. Many do not like the electoral college for these reasons and many others such as it can be a disaster or because it is just plain dumb. Also there are a few reasons why the electoral college should be kept such as avoiding runoff elections or big states, but those not in favor of it out weigh those in favor of it. The people who despise the electoral college are in favor of popular vote since it is the better choice.

For various reasons the electoral college is unfair such as not everyones decisions count just those few people in the electoral college. In a popular vote election everyones vote counts not just those who are considered better than us because they hold authority over people. Those people can also be sneaky and can change votes to be in favor of their choice of president. They will even take bribes sometimes just because they can even though us other people do count.

The system should not even be here today because it is outdated way past our time. "It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolsi the electoral college!" Plumer, Source 2 and many others do agree with this statement because it rather true that we do so instead of let a bunch of monkeys run our states and country, but I am pretty sure that sometimes they could even do a better job than those in office right now. ".....over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now" Plumer, Source 2 every day as we continue that percentage continues to grow and that data was recorded in 2000.

Lastly, the electoral college is irrational like seriously what idiotic person came up with this. I will say this again, but a monkey could of made a better system than this. "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president........Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, soemtimes the presidential candidate themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. DO voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candiate? Sometimes" Plumer, Source 2 I know this statement says it all because how could one simply not want popular vote after reading this.

I know that electoral college vote can help and not cause problems, but there are more problems while there is one easy fix which is popular vote. "It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational" Plumer, Source 2.

Dear senator, Retain the Electoral College. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electors is is required to elect the President. Each state has hisher own electors which are chosen by the candidate political party. You should keep the Electoral College because you have certainty of outcome, and the President is everyones not just yours.

The first reason why you should stay with the Electoral College is because you are certain that the outcome will be in favor of one of the candidates. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote may happen but it is very unlikely that it will even though that 538number of electors in the Electoral College is a even numberS.3.For example in 2012's election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to 51.3 percent of the popular cast for him and rodney because all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that stateS.3. However,because of the winnertakeall system in each state,candidates dont spend time in staes they know they have no chance of winning, they only focus on the close,tight races in the "swing"statesS.2. But, the winning candidates share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

The second reason you should keep the Electoral College is because the president is everyone's. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president by themselves. So for example,a solid regional favorite,such as rodney was in the South,has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states he knows for sure that he will winS.3.A president with only his regional apppeal is very unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions may feel like there votes dont count or that he really isnt there president.

In conclusion, you should stay with the Electoral College simply because you most likely not going to have a tie and because the president is everyone's.

Limiting car use causes pollution, increases costs to users regardless of where services or services are offered. Furthermore, over use of the gas results in increased environmental degradation, harming our resources while damaging our environment.

When consumers pay a larger amount before gasoline is refined then there are higher costs of running the engine than otherwise. There are fewer places where the gas can be purchased locally causing more problems. Car trips will usually have higher tolls which results in lost wages for the transportation worker, who goes to an unnecessary location for work and then returns home and gets to pay back his transportation back costs. The car accident rate amongst children also has increased. Car pollution can become airborne easily, contaminating children's health. Also children tend to be more careless and more often in accidents simply because of being pushed out of their cars onto the road. All of this can be done to better an already polluted Earth that is becoming increasingly damaged at a much faster rate. Limiting our vehicle use helps our citizens with a reduced budget. It also reduces pollution for local areas. Furthermore, it improves public health and makes city dwellers a wealthier society.

Limiting our own usage by adopting public transportation, walking, biking, and public transport actually would be beneficial for the citizens and planet. I think its very healthy but very little others show similar sentiment mostly environmental activists who want a more environmentally clean place so it often is still looked down upon it still will bring about a very drastic price eventually but there will never be carbon credit trading or an oil recycling scheme unless people want it too. Limiting car use is good for the city.

Advantages of Limiting Car Usage 

Limiting car usage can have a number of advantages for individuals and the community as a whole. The passage set provides evidence of this trend happening in different parts of the world, including Germany, France, and Colombia. In these places, efforts have been made to reduce the dependence on cars and promote alternative modes of transportation. Limiting car usage can lead to a cleaner environment, healthier individuals, and better community planning.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease the amount of pollution being released into the environment. This is particularly important in densely populated areas like cities, where air pollution can have severe health consequences for residents.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have positive impacts on individual health. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, mentions that millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work on that particular day. Engaging in physical activity like walking or cycling instead of driving can help improve cardiovascular health and overall fitness. It can also reduce the risk of obesity and related diseases.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to better community planning and more efficient land use. The passage about Vauban, Germany, describes a community where street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden. Instead, emphasis is placed on public transportation and walking. This approach makes it easier for people to access amenities and services on foot and reduces the need for large parking lots and sprawling developments. Compact and walkable communities can promote social interaction, reduce traffic congestion, and improve quality of life.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have a range of advantages for both individuals and communities. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, promote physical activity and better health, and lead to more efficient community planning. As the passages suggest, these efforts are already being implemented in different parts of the world. It is important for individuals to consider alternative modes of transportation and make choices that contribute to a cleaner and healthier future.
